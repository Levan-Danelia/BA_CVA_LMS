### **3\. GENERAL PROVISIONS**

**3.1** A firm must calculate its own funds requirements for CVA risk using the following approaches:

1. if it has permission to use SA-CVA, in accordance with Chapter 5;  
2. if it does not have permission to use SA-CVA:  
   * (a) if 4.1 applies, BA-CVA under Chapter 4; or  
   * (b) if 6.1 applies, the alternative approach under Chapter 6\.

**3.2** In addition to transactions that must be excluded under point (b) of Article 382(4) of CRR, a firm may exclude from its calculation of own funds requirements for CVA risk transactions that meet the following conditions:

1. the counterparty is:  
   * (a) included in the firm’s prudential consolidation group on a full basis; or  
   * (b) an entity in the firm’s group and the transaction between the counterparty and the firm is eliminated on accounting consolidation under the applicable accounting framework or the accounting standards applicable to the firm’s ultimate parent undertaking;  
2. both the counterparty and the firm are subject to appropriate centralised risk evaluation, measurement and control procedures; and  
3. there are no current or foreseen material practical or legal impediment to the prompt transfer of own funds or repayment of liabilities from the counterparty to the firm.

**3.3** A firm must:

1. notify the PRA in writing three months prior to the date at which it starts excluding transactions with a counterparty in accordance with 3.2 and confirm the notification every three years thereafter; and  
2. include in each notification to the PRA:  
   * (a) the name of the counterparty excluded in accordance with 3.2; and  
   * (b) an explanation of how the conditions in 3.2 are met.

**3.4** A firm must:

1. if it hedges CVA risk, use only eligible CVA hedges;  
2. not include external CVA hedges that are eligible CVA hedges in its calculation of its own funds requirements for market risk under the market risk Parts; and  
3. include external CVA hedges that are not eligible CVA hedges in its trading book calculation of market risk own funds requirements under the market risk Parts.

**3.5** A firm may include an internal CVA hedge that is subject to curvature risk in accordance with Market Risk: Advanced Standardised Approach (CRR) Part Articles 325e and 325g, default risk charge in accordance with Market Risk: Advanced Standardised Approach (CRR) Part Articles 325v to 325ad, or residual risk add-on in accordance with Market Risk: Advanced Standardised Approach (CRR) Part Article 325u, as an eligible CVA hedge only if the trading desk that is the internal counterparty to the CVA desk enters into a transaction or a set of transactions with one or more external counterparties that exactly offsets the trading desk’s position with the CVA desk.

**3.6** For the purposes of 4.4, 5.27 and 5.28, where a counterparty is not externally rated, a firm that has been granted permission from the PRA under the Credit Risk: Internal Ratings Based Approach (CRR) Part Article 143 to use the internal rating based approach in accordance with the Credit Risk: Internal Rating Based Approach (CRR) Part to calculate credit risk own funds requirements in respect of exposures to the counterparty must map the internal rating to an external rating and assign a risk weight corresponding to either investment grade or high yield.

### **4\. BASIC APPROACH**

**4.1** A firm that:

1. does not have permission from the PRA to use SA-CVA; and  
2. if relevant to the firm, has not chosen to use the alternative approach in Chapter 6;  
   must calculate its own funds requirements for CVA risk for covered transactions in accordance with this Chapter.

#### **Reduced version of BA-CVA**

4.2 If a firm does not use any eligible BA-CVA hedges to hedge CVA risk it must calculate its own funds requirement for CVA risk in accordance with the following formula:

$$DS\_{BA-CVA} \\times K\_{reduced}$$

where:

$$DS\_{BA-CVA} \= 0.65$$

and $K\_{reduced}$ is calculated in accordance with the following formula:

$$K\_{reduced} \= \\sqrt{(\\rho \\cdot \\sum\_{C} SCVA\_c)^2 \+ (1 \- \\rho^2) \\cdot \\sum\_{C} SCVA\_c^2}$$

where:

* $SCVA\_c$ \= the own funds requirement for counterparty $c$ on a standalone basis, calculated in accordance with 4.3;  
* $\\rho \= 50\\%$, the supervisory correlation parameter;  
* $C$ \= all counterparties for which the firm uses BA-CVA to calculate its own funds requirements for CVA risk.

4.3 For the purposes of 4.2, a firm must calculate $SCVA\_c$ in accordance with the following formula:

$$SCVA\_c \= \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\cdot RW\_c \\cdot \\sum\_{NS} M\_{NS} \\cdot EAD\_{NS} \\cdot DF\_{NS}$$

where:

* $RW\_c$ is the risk weight for a counterparty that reflects the volatility of its credit spread as prescribed in the table at 4.4;  
* $NS$ \= netting set;  
* $M\_{NS}$ is the effective maturity for the netting set, calculated:  
  1. for a firm using the methods set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 6, Section 6 of CRR:  
     * (a) in accordance with point (g) of paragraph 2 of Credit Risk: Internal Ratings Based Approach (CRR) Part Article 162 for netting sets with a maturity of greater than one year, except that $M\_{NS}$ is not capped at five years but instead at the longest contractual remaining maturity in the netting set; or  
     * (b) paragraph 2 of Credit Risk: Internal Ratings Based Approach (CRR) Part Article 162 for netting sets with a maturity of less than one year;  
  2. for a firm not using the methods set out in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 6, Section 6 of CRR, using the average notional weighted maturity in accordance with paragraph 2 of Credit Risk: Internal Ratings Based Approach (CRR) Part Article 162, except $M\_{NS}$ is not capped at five years but instead at the longest contractual remaining maturity in the netting set;  
* $EAD\_{NS}$ is the exposure at default of the netting set, calculated in the same manner in which the firm calculates exposure at default for determining own funds requirements for counterparty credit risk, in accordance with either Sections 3 to 5 of Counterparty Credit Risk (CRR) Part or Part 3, Title II, Chapter 6, Section 6 of CRR;  
* $DF\_{NS}$, the supervisory discount factor for the netting set, is:  
  1. $1$ if a firm has been granted permission from the PRA under Article 283 of CRR to use the Internal Model Method to calculate the exposure at default as part of its own funds requirements calculation for counterparty credit risk; or  
  2. $\\frac{1 \- e^{-0.05 \\cdot M\_{NS}}}{0.05 \\cdot M\_{NS}}$ if a firm does not have permission to use the Internal Model Method to calculate exposure at default;  
* $\\alpha$ \= the value of $\\alpha$ as specified in paragraph 2 of Counterparty Credit Risk (CRR) Part Article 274;  
* $c$ \= all counterparties for which the firm uses BA-CVA to calculate its own funds requirements for CVA risk and with which the firm has at least one covered transaction.

**4.4** For the purposes of 4.3, a firm must set the value of $RW\_c$ in accordance with the table below:

| Sector of counterparty | Credit quality of counterparty: Investment grade | Credit quality of counterparty: High yield and Non-rated |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Sovereigns including central banks and multilateral development banks | 0.5% | 2.0% |
| Local government, government-backed non-financials, education and public administration | 1.0% | 4.0% |
| Financials including government-backed financials, excluding pension funds | 5.0% | 12.0% |
| Pension funds | 3.5% | 8.5% |
| Basic materials, energy, industrials, agriculture, manufacturing, mining and quarrying | 3.0% | 7.0% |
| Consumer goods and services, transportation and storage, administrative and support service activities | 3.0% | 8.5% |
| Technology, telecommunications | 2.0% | 5.5% |
| Health care, utilities, professional and technical activities | 1.5% | 5.0% |
| Other sector | 5.0% | 12.0% |

#### **Full version of BA-CVA**

4.5 If a firm uses one or more eligible BA-CVA hedges to hedge CVA risk it must calculate its own funds requirement for CVA risk in accordance with the following formula:

$$DS\_{BA-CVA} \\times K\_{full}$$

where:

$$DS\_{BA-CVA} \= 0.65$$$$K\_{full} \= \\beta \\cdot K\_{reduced} \+ (1 \- \\beta) \\cdot K\_{hedged}$$

where:

$$\\beta \= 0.25$$

$K\_{reduced}$ is calculated in accordance with 4.2.  
4.6 For the purposes of 4.5, a firm must calculate $K\_{hedged}$ in accordance with the following formula:

$$K\_{hedged} \= \\sqrt{\\left(\\rho \\cdot \\sum\_{C} (SCVA\_c \- SNH\_c) \- IH\\right)^2 \+ (1 \- \\rho^2) \\cdot \\sum\_{C} (SCVA\_c \- SNH\_c)^2 \+ \\sum\_{C} HMAC\_c}$$

where:

* $SCVA\_c$ is calculated in accordance with 4.3;  
* $\\rho \= 50\\%$;  
* $SNH\_c$ is calculated in accordance with 4.7;  
* $IH$ is calculated in accordance with 4.8;  
* $HMAC$ is calculated in accordance with 4.9;  
* $c$ \= all counterparties for which the firm uses BA-CVA to calculate its own funds requirements for CVA risk and with which the firm has at least one covered transaction.

4.7 For the purposes of 4.6, a firm must calculate $SNH\_c$ in accordance with the following formula:

$$SNH\_c \= \\sum\_{h \\in C} r\_{hc} \\cdot RW\_h \\cdot M\_h^{SN} \\cdot B\_h^{SN} \\cdot DF\_h^{SN}$$

where:

* $r\_{hc}$ \= the supervisory correlation between the credit spread of counterparty $c$ and the credit spread of a single-name hedge $h$ of counterparty ($c$) determined in accordance with the table at 4.10;  
* $M\_h^{SN}$ \= the remaining maturity of a single-name eligible BA-CVA hedge;  
* $B\_h^{SN}$ \= the notional of single-name eligible BA-CVA hedge ($h$) (for single-name contingent credit default swaps, the notional must be determined by the current market value of the reference portfolio or instrument);  
* $DF\_h^{SN}$ \= the supervisory discount factor for a single-name hedge, calculated as:  
  $$\\frac{1 \- e^{-0.05 \\cdot M\_h^{SN}}}{0.05 \\cdot M\_h^{SN}}$$  
* $RW\_h$ \= the supervisory risk weight of single-name hedge $h$ that reflects the volatility of the credit spread of the reference name of the hedging instrument set in accordance with the table at 4.4;  
* $h$ \= the index that denotes all single name eligible BA-CVA hedges that the firm has taken out to hedge the CVA risk of a counterparty.

4.8 For the purposes of 4.6, a firm must calculate $IH$ in accordance with the following formula:

$$IH \= \\sum\_{i} RW\_i^{ind} \\cdot M\_i^{ind} \\cdot B\_i^{ind} \\cdot DF\_i^{ind}$$

where:

* $M\_i^{ind}$ \= the remaining maturity of index eligible BA-CVA hedge;  
* $B\_i^{ind}$ \= the notional of the index eligible BA-CVA hedge;  
* $DF\_i^{ind}$ \= the supervisory discount factor calculated in accordance with the following formula:  
  $$\\frac{1 \- e^{-0.05 \\cdot M\_i^{ind}}}{0.05 \\cdot M\_i^{ind}}$$  
* $RW\_i^{ind}$ is the supervisory risk weight of the index eligible BA-CVA hedge, as specified in the table at 4.4 but adjusted as follows:  
  1. for an index where all index constituents belong to the same sector and are of the same credit quality, the firm must multiply the relevant value in Table 1 by $0.7$;  
  2. for an index spanning multiple sectors or with a mixture of investment grade constituents and other grade constituents, the firm must calculate the name-weighted average of the risk weights from Table 1 and then multiply by $0.7$;  
* $i$ \= the index that denotes all index hedges that the firm has taken out to hedge CVA risk.

4.9 For the purposes of 4.6, a firm must calculate $HMAC$ in accordance with the following formula:

$$HMAC \= \\sum\_{h \\in C} (1 \- r\_{hc}^2) \\cdot (RW\_h \\cdot M\_h^{SN} \\cdot B\_h^{SN} \\cdot DF\_h^{SN})^2$$

where:  
$r\_{hc}$, $M\_h^{SN}$, $B\_h^{SN}$, $DF\_h^{SN}$, and $RW\_h$ are as set out in 4.7.  
**4.10** For the purposes of 4.7, a firm must set the value of $r\_{hc}$ in accordance with the table below:

| Single name hedge of counterparty c | Value of rhc​ |
| :---- | :---- |
| references counterparty $c$ directly | 100% |
| is legally related to counterparty $c$ | 80% |
| shares sector and region with counterparty $c$ | 50% |
