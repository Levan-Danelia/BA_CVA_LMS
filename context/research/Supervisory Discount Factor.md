Based on our conversation history, the **Supervisory Discount Factor
(\$DF\_{NS}\$)** is determined at the **netting set level** 1.

As the provided sources 1--4 focus specifically on maturity, the
following details regarding the discount factor are drawn from our
conversation history:

### Calculation of the Discount Factor (\$DF\_{NS}\$)

Firm Category,Discount Factor Value/Formula,Methodology

Non-IMM,\$\\frac{1 - e\^{-0.05 \\cdot M\_{NS}}}{0.05 \\cdot
M\_{NS}}\$,Calculated using a fixed 5% supervisory discount rate applied
over the Effective Maturity (\$M\_{NS}\$) of the netting set.

IMM,1.0,Firms with permission to use the Internal Model Method are
permitted to use a constant value of 1.0.

### Key Characteristics

-   **Netting Set Application:** The factor is calculated individually
    > for each netting set based on its specific effective maturity 1.

-   **Supervisory Rate:** For firms not using internal models, the
    > formula uses a continuous-time discount approach with a flat **5%
    > rate**.

-   **Model Simplification:** For **IMM firms**, the value is set to
    > **1.0** to reduce operational burden or to account for the fact
    > that IMM exposure profiles may already incorporate time-weighted
    > risks.

-   **Maturity Dependence:** For Non-IMM firms, the value of the
    > discount factor is entirely dependent on the **Effective Maturity
    > (\$M\_{NS}\$)** 2, 3. As the maturity of a netting set increases,
    > the resulting discount factor decreases.
