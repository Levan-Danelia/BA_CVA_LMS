# Technical Analysis of Single-Name Hedging Mechanisms and Misalignment Adjustments under PRA BA-CVA

## 1. Architectural Framework of the Full Basic Approach

The Basic Approach for Credit Valuation Adjustment (BA-CVA), as
delineated in the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) Policy
Statements PS17/23 and PS9/24, establishes a bifurcated capital adequacy
framework designed to capture the risk of mark-to-market losses
associated with the deterioration of counterparty creditworthiness.
While the Reduced BA-CVA offers a simplified, conservative calculation
for unhedged portfolios, the Full BA-CVA provides a mechanism for firms
to recognize the risk-mitigating effects of eligible hedging
instruments. This analysis focuses exclusively on the mechanics of the
Full BA-CVA, specifically examining the mathematical and regulatory
treatment of single-name hedges (SNH) and the penalties associated with
basis risk and misalignment.

The Full BA-CVA does not allow for a simple subtraction of hedge
notionals from exposure notionals. Instead, it employs a structured
aggregation function that incorporates supervisory correlation
parameters to distinguish between systematic and idiosyncratic risk
components. The efficacy of single-name hedging strategies is
constrained by a supervisory floor and penalized for imperfect alignment
through the Hedging Mismatch Adjustment (HMAC).

### 1.1 The Capital Aggregation Function (**\$K\_{full}\$**)

The determination of the final Own Funds Requirement (OFR) under the
Full BA-CVA is governed by a weighted aggregation formula that blends
the capital requirements of the unhedged portfolio (\$K\_{reduced}\$)
with those of the hedged portfolio (\$K\_{hedged}\$). This formulation
ensures that capital relief is granted only partially, maintaining a
non-negligible capital buffer even in the presence of extensive hedging.

The overarching formula for the Full BA-CVA capital charge is expressed
as:

\$\$K\_{full} = \\beta \\cdot K\_{reduced} + (1 - \\beta) \\cdot
K\_{hedged}\$\$

In this equation, the parameter \$\\beta\$ (Beta) serves as a critical
supervisory lever. Set rigidly at **0.25** (25%), \$\\beta\$ imposes a
floor on the capital benefit derived from hedging.^1^ By weighting the
unhedged \$K\_{reduced}\$ term at 25%, the regulator ensures that firms
must capitalize at least a quarter of the gross systematic and
idiosyncratic risk of their derivatives portfolio, regardless of the
theoretical effectiveness of their hedges. Consequently, the
\$K\_{hedged}\$ term---where single-name hedges are mathematically
recognized---can only influence 75% of the total capital outcome.

This structure reflects a regulatory skepticism regarding the ability of
standardized formulas to perfectly capture the residual risks inherent
in hedging complex over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. It explicitly
accounts for the potential failure of hedge correlations during periods
of systemic stress, where historical relationships between reference
entities often break down.

### 1.2 The Mathematical Composition of **\$K\_{hedged}\$**

The \$K\_{hedged}\$ component is the primary engine for hedge
recognition. It employs a square-root-of-sum-of-squares (SRSS)
aggregation methodology that splits counterparty risk into two
orthogonal vectors: systematic risk and idiosyncratic risk.
Understanding this split is essential for analyzing how single-name
hedges reduce capital.

The formula for \$K\_{hedged}\$ is defined in the PRA Rulebook as:

\$\$K\_{hedged} = \\sqrt{ \\left( \\rho \\cdot \\sum\_{c} (SCVA_c -
SNH_c) - IH \\right)\^2 + (1 - \\rho\^2) \\cdot \\sum\_{c} (SCVA_c -
SNH_c)\^2 + \\sum\_{c} HMAC_c }\$\$

This formula reveals the dual impact of single-name hedges (\$SNH_c\$):

1.  **Systematic Risk Reduction:** The first term under the square root,
    > \$\\left( \\rho \\cdot \\sum (SCVA_c - SNH_c) - IH \\right)\^2\$,
    > represents the portfolio\'s exposure to general market credit
    > spread movements. The supervisory correlation parameter \$\\rho\$
    > is fixed at **0.50** (50%).^1^ Here, the single-name hedge
    > \$SNH_c\$ directly offsets the Standalone CVA (\$SCVA_c\$) for
    > counterparty \$c\$. Because this term is squared *after*
    > summation, hedges on one counterparty can offset exposures to
    > other counterparties, provided they reduce the net systematic
    > exposure of the portfolio.

2.  **Idiosyncratic Risk Reduction:** The second term, \$(1 - \\rho\^2)
    > \\cdot \\sum (SCVA_c - SNH_c)\^2\$, captures the specific default
    > risk associated with individual counterparties. With \$\\rho =
    > 0.5\$, the weight \$(1 - \\rho\^2)\$ equals **0.75**. In this
    > component, the netting of \$SNH_c\$ against \$SCVA_c\$ occurs
    > *before* squaring and summation. This implies that single-name
    > hedges are highly effective at reducing the idiosyncratic capital
    > charge, as they neutralize the large squared terms generated by
    > significant individual exposures.

Crucially, the formula includes a third, additive term: \$\\sum
HMAC_c\$. The Hedging Mismatch Adjustment (\$HMAC_c\$) is a penalty term
that sits outside the square root aggregation (in some representations)
or is added to the variance. In the PRA\'s specific implementation, it
is treated as a direct add-on for basis risk, ensuring that imperfect
hedges (proxies) increase the capital requirement linearly, without the
benefit of portfolio diversification.^1^

### 1.3 The Discount Scalar (**\$DS\_{BA-CVA}\$**)

It is important to note that the final output of the BA-CVA calculation
is subject to a Discount Scalar (\$DS\_{BA-CVA}\$) of **0.65**.^1^ This
scalar is applied to the aggregate capital requirement (\$K\_{full}\$)
to calibrate the standardized approach against modeled outcomes and
prevent punitive capital spikes relative to the outgoing methods. While
the scalar reduces the absolute capital figure, it does not alter the
relative mechanics or incentives of single-name hedging. The ratio of
hedge recognition to misalignment penalty remains constant regardless of
the scalar.

## 2. Mechanics of the Single-Name Hedge (**\$SNH_c\$**) Calculation

The variable \$SNH_c\$ allows firms to quantify the risk-mitigating
value of eligible single-name credit default swaps (CDS) and contingent
CDS. This value is not simply the notional amount of the derivative;
rather, it is a risk-weighted, discounted, and maturity-adjusted figure
that is further scaled by a correlation parameter reflecting the quality
of the match between the hedge and the underlying counterparty exposure.

### 2.1 The **\$SNH_c\$** Formula

According to Article 4.7 of the relevant PRA Rulebook section
(referenced in ^1^ and ^1^), the quantity \$SNH_c\$ must be calculated
as follows:

\$\$SNH_c = \\sum\_{h \\in c} r\_{hc} \\cdot RW_h \\cdot M_h\^{SN}
\\cdot B_h\^{SN} \\cdot DF_h\^{SN}\$\$

This summation aggregates all eligible hedges \$h\$ that have been
mapped to counterparty \$c\$. Each component of this formula is
rigorously defined to ensure consistency with the calculation of the
underlying exposure (\$SCVA_c\$).

### 2.2 Component Analysis

#### 2.2.1 Supervisory Correlation (**\$r\_{hc}\$**)

The parameter \$r\_{hc}\$ is the most critical variable for determining
the efficiency of a hedge. It represents the supervisory correlation
between the credit spread of the counterparty \$c\$ and the credit
spread of the hedging instrument \$h\$.

-   **Regulatory Function:** It acts as a scaling factor for the hedge
    > notional. A correlation of 100% allows the full risk-weighted
    > notional to offset the exposure. Lower correlations (80% or 50%)
    > reduce the recognized hedging benefit linearly within the
    > \$SNH_c\$ term.

-   **Prescriptive Nature:** Unlike internal models that might estimate
    > historical correlations, the BA-CVA mandates the use of specific
    > values based on the legal and sectoral relationship between the
    > entities. These values are strictly limited to 100%, 80%, and
    > 50%.^3^

#### 2.2.2 Supervisory Risk Weight of the Hedge (**\$RW_h\$**)

The risk weight \$RW_h\$ reflects the volatility of the credit spread of
the reference name of the hedging instrument.

-   **Determination:** This value is taken from the same supervisory
    > Table 1 used to assign risk weights to counterparties
    > (\$RW_c\$).^1^

-   **Mismatch Implications:** In a perfect hedge, the reference entity
    > of the CDS is the counterparty itself, meaning \$RW_h = RW_c\$.
    > However, in proxy hedging scenarios, \$RW_h\$ is determined by the
    > sector and credit quality of the *hedge\'s reference entity*. This
    > ensures that if a firm hedges a High Yield counterparty (\$RW_c =
    > 12\\%\$) with an Investment Grade index proxy or single-name proxy
    > (\$RW_h = 5\\%\$), the hedge recognition in \$SNH_c\$ is
    > appropriately lower, reflecting the lower volatility (and thus
    > lower protection value) of the investment grade instrument against
    > the high-yield exposure.^2^

#### 2.2.3 Effective Maturity of the Hedge (**\$M_h\^{SN}\$**)

\$M_h\^{SN}\$ represents the remaining maturity of the single-name
eligible BA-CVA hedge, expressed in years.

-   **Calculation:** This input must reflect the actual contractual
    > remaining maturity of the hedging instrument.

-   **Interaction with Exposure Maturity:** The underlying exposure term
    > (\$SCVA_c\$) utilizes the netting set effective maturity
    > (\$M\_{NS}\$). If the hedge maturity \$M_h\^{SN}\$ is shorter than
    > \$M\_{NS}\$, the hedge provides only partial duration coverage.
    > The formula captures this linearly: a shorter \$M_h\^{SN}\$
    > results in a smaller \$SNH_c\$ value, reducing the offset against
    > the larger \$SCVA_c\$ term. This creates a \"maturity mismatch\"
    > penalty implicit in the subtraction logic.^1^

#### 2.2.4 Notional of the Hedge (**\$B_h\^{SN}\$**)

\$B_h\^{SN}\$ is the nominal amount of the single-name eligible BA-CVA
hedge.

-   **Standard CDS:** For standard credit default swaps, this is the
    > face value of the protection purchased.

-   **Contingent CDS:** For single-name contingent credit default swaps,
    > the rules specify that the notional must be determined by the
    > **current market value** of the reference portfolio or instrument.
    > This requirement is crucial for contingent hedges, as the
    > protection they offer is dynamic and dependent on the valuation of
    > the underlying assets. Using the current market value ensures that
    > the hedge notional reflects the active economic exposure at the
    > time of the capital calculation.^1^

#### 2.2.5 Supervisory Discount Factor (**\$DF_h\^{SN}\$**)

The supervisory discount factor aligns the time value of money of the
hedge with the regulatory assumptions used for the exposure.

-   Formula:\
    > \
    > \$\$DF_h\^{SN} = \\frac{1 - e\^{-0.05 \\cdot M_h\^{SN}}}{0.05
    > \\cdot M_h\^{SN}}\$\$

-   **Rate:** The formula utilizes a fixed supervisory discount rate of
    > **5% (0.05)**. This rate is consistent with the discount factor
    > applied to non-IMM firm exposures in the \$SCVA_c\$
    > calculation.^1^

-   **Function:** The discount factor effectively calculates the present
    > value of an annuity (the spread payments) over the life of the
    > hedge. As the maturity \$M_h\^{SN}\$ increases, the discount
    > factor \$DF_h\^{SN}\$ decreases, reflecting the reduced present
    > value sensitivity of distant cash flows relative to the notional.
    > This ensures that long-dated hedges are not over-weighted in the
    > capital calculation compared to the actual economic protection
    > they provide in present value terms.

## 3. Supervisory Correlation Parameters (**\$r\_{hc}\$**) and Basis Risk Hierarchy

The BA-CVA framework rejects the use of internal model-based correlation
estimates for hedge recognition. Instead, it enforces a rigid hierarchy
of correlation parameters (\$r\_{hc}\$) that categorizes hedging
relationships into three tiers of basis risk. This hierarchy is
fundamental to the calculation of both the hedge benefit (\$SNH_c\$) and
the misalignment penalty (\$HMAC\$).

The specific values for \$r\_{hc}\$ are mandated as follows ^3^:

  **Correlation Bucket (rhc​)**   **Eligibility Criteria**   **Relationship Definition**                                                                 **Basis Risk Assessment**
  ------------------------------- -------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **100%**                        **Direct Reference**       The hedge reference entity is the exact counterparty \$c\$.                                 **Zero Basis Risk:** The hedge is perfectly aligned with the credit risk of the counterparty.
  **80%**                         **Legally Related**        The reference entity is legally related to counterparty \$c\$ (e.g., Parent/Subsidiary).    **Moderate Basis Risk:** Recognizes strong economic links but allows for idiosyncratic spread divergence.
  **50%**                         **Sector & Region**        The reference entity belongs to the same **Sector** and **Region** as counterparty \$c\$.   **High Basis Risk:** Proxy hedging using a peer entity. Substantial residual risk remains.

### 3.1 Tier 1: Direct Reference (100% Correlation)

-   **Definition:** This bucket is exclusive to hedges where the
    > reference entity of the CDS matches the counterparty of the
    > netting set.

-   **Formulaic Impact:** With \$r\_{hc} = 1.0\$, the full risk-weighted
    > discounted notional of the hedge is recognized in the \$SNH_c\$
    > term.

-   **HMAC Implications:** The misalignment term in the HMAC calculation
    > depends on \$(1 - r\_{hc}\^2)\$. For direct hedges, \$(1 - 1\^2) =
    > 0\$. Therefore, **no HMAC penalty** is applied. This design
    > creates a maximum regulatory incentive for firms to hedge using
    > direct-reference instruments, as they provide the highest capital
    > relief with zero penalty add-on.^2^

### 3.2 Tier 2: Legally Related Entities (80% Correlation)

-   **Definition:** This bucket applies when the hedge references an
    > entity with a defined legal relationship to the counterparty. The
    > regulations specifically cite cases where the reference name and
    > the counterparty are either a parent and its subsidiary, or two
    > subsidiaries of a common parent.^3^

-   **Economic Rationale:** Legally related entities typically exhibit
    > high correlation in credit spreads due to shared governance,
    > capital structures, and cross-default clauses. However, they are
    > not identical; distinct operational risks or ring-fencing can
    > cause spreads to decouple. The 80% correlation captures this
    > potential divergence.

-   **Formulaic Impact:** The recognized notional in \$SNH_c\$ is scaled
    > by 0.80.

-   **HMAC Implications:** The penalty factor becomes \$(1 - 0.80\^2) =
    > (1 - 0.64) = 0.36\$. Firms must hold additional capital equivalent
    > to 36% of the squared risk-weighted hedge value to cover the basis
    > risk between the related entities.

### 3.3 Tier 3: Same Sector and Region (50% Correlation)

-   **Definition:** This is the \"proxy hedge\" bucket. It applies when
    > the hedge references an entity that is neither the counterparty
    > nor legally related, but falls within the same **Sector** and
    > **Region** buckets.^2^

-   **Operational Context:** This tier is vital for managing the risk of
    > illiquid counterparties (e.g., small corporate clients) where no
    > direct CDS market exists. Firms often use liquid CDS on large,
    > stable peers (e.g., using a Vodafone CDS to hedge a smaller
    > telecom exposure) to mitigate general sector/region credit spread
    > widening.

-   **Formulaic Impact:** The recognized notional in \$SNH_c\$ is scaled
    > by 0.50. This effectively halves the recognized mitigation value
    > of the hedge in the systematic and idiosyncratic calculations.

-   **HMAC Implications:** The penalty factor is \$(1 - 0.50\^2) = (1 -
    > 0.25) = 0.75\$. This is a severe penalty; 75% of the variance
    > contribution of the hedge is added back as a standalone charge.
    > This high cost reflects the regulator\'s view that proxy hedging
    > is an imperfect science and often leaves the firm exposed to
    > significant idiosyncratic risk of the counterparty.^1^

## 4. The Hedging Mismatch Adjustment (HMAC)

The Hedging Mismatch Adjustment (HMAC) is the corrective mechanism
within the Full BA-CVA that quantifies the \"safety tax\" on proxy
hedging. It ensures that the capital relief granted via the \$SNH_c\$
term is partially clawed back to account for the basis risk inherent in
correlations of less than 100%.

### 4.1 The HMAC Formula

The calculation of HMAC is additive across all counterparties and
hedges. Unlike the diversification allowed in the main \$K\_{hedged}\$
formula, HMAC aggregates linearly. The formula is defined as:

\$\$HMAC = \\sum\_{c} \\sum\_{h \\in c} (1 - r\_{hc}\^2) \\cdot \\left(
RW_h \\cdot M_h\^{SN} \\cdot B_h\^{SN} \\cdot DF_h\^{SN} \\right)\^2\$\$

This mathematical structure drives several key risk management
implications ^1^:

### 4.2 Structural Characteristics of the Penalty

1.  **Linear Aggregation (No Diversification):** The use of a simple
    > summation (\$\\sum\$) means that basis risks are treated as
    > additive. Misalignment in a hedge for Counterparty A cannot be
    > offset by alignment or misalignment in Counterparty B. Every proxy
    > hedge contributes positively to the total capital charge.

2.  **Quadratic Scaling:** The penalty scales with the **square** of the
    > risk-weighted notional term \$\\left( RW_h \\cdot M_h\^{SN} \\cdot
    > B_h\^{SN} \\cdot DF_h\^{SN} \\right)\^2\$.

    -   *Significance:* This convexity means that large notional proxy
        > hedges are penalized disproportionately heavily compared to
        > smaller ones. Doubling the size of a proxy hedge results in a
        > fourfold increase in the HMAC contribution (before the
        > correlation factor). This discourages the use of massive
        > single-name proxies to hedge portfolio-wide risks, favoring
        > more granular hedging strategies.

3.  **Risk Weight Sensitivity:** The penalty is highly sensitive to the
    > volatility of the hedging instrument (\$RW_h\$). Proxy hedging
    > using a volatile, high-risk-weight instrument (e.g., High Yield
    > Financials, \$RW=12\\%\$) incurs a dramatically higher HMAC charge
    > than hedging with a stable instrument (e.g., Investment Grade
    > Sovereign, \$RW=0.5\\%\$), even if the correlation tier (50%) is
    > identical. The squared risk weight term (\$RW_h\^2\$) amplifies
    > this difference.

4.  **Correlation Sensitivity:** The term \$(1 - r\_{hc}\^2)\$
    > determines the proportion of the squared hedge value that is
    > penalized.

    -   At \$r\_{hc} = 100\\%\$, penalty = 0%.

    -   At \$r\_{hc} = 80\\%\$, penalty = 36%.

    -   At \$r\_{hc} = 50\\%\$, penalty = 75%.\
        > The jump from legal-relation hedging to sector-proxy hedging
        > roughly doubles the misalignment penalty factor.

## 5. Sector Definitions and Risk Weight Mapping (Table 1)

To determine the appropriate Supervisory Risk Weight (\$RW_c\$ for
counterparties, \$RW_h\$ for hedges) and to validate eligibility for the
50% \"Same Sector\" correlation bucket, firms must classify entities
according to the buckets specified in \"Table 1\" of the PRA Rulebook.
The assignment depends on the entity\'s sector and its credit quality
step (Investment Grade vs. High Yield/Unrated).

### 5.1 Supervisory Risk Weights (**\$RW\$**)

The research material provides a comprehensive mapping of these sectors
and their associated risk weights ^1^:

  **Sector Bucket**                                      **Investment Grade (IG) Weight**   **High Yield (HY) / Unrated Weight**
  ------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------
  **Sovereigns** (Central Govts, Central Banks, MDBs)    **0.5%**                           **2.0% - 3.0%** (varies by specific rating)
  **Local Government / PSEs** (Public Sector Entities)   **1.0%**                           **4.0%**
  **Financials** (Banks, Insurers, Pension Funds\*)      **5.0%**                           **12.0%**
  **Basic Materials / Energy / Industrials**             **3.0%**                           **7.0%**
  **Consumer Goods / Services**                          **3.0%**                           **8.5%**
  **Technology / Telecommunications**                    **2.0%**                           **5.5%**
  **Health Care / Utilities**                            **1.5%**                           **5.0%**
  **Other Sector**                                       **5.0%**                           **12.0%**

-   **Financials Note:** The \"Financials\" bucket is broad,
    > encompassing credit institutions, investment firms, and
    > re/insurance undertakings. The 12.0% risk weight for HY/Unrated
    > Financials is notably punitive, making proxy hedging of
    > lower-quality financial counterparties extremely expensive
    > regarding HMAC (due to the \$RW\^2\$ term).

-   **Pension Funds:** While specific CVA exemptions or Alpha factor
    > adjustments (1.0 vs 1.4) exist for Pension Funds in the UK rules
    > ^2^, for the purpose of risk weighting in Table 1, they generally
    > fall within the Financials bucket unless a specific sub-bucket is
    > designated in the final instrument.

-   **Unrated Central Banks:** These are mapped to the risk weight of
    > the relevant central government (Sovereign).^2^

### 5.2 Application to Misalignment

For a hedge to qualify for the 50% correlation bucket:

1.  **Sector Match:** The hedge reference entity must map to the *exact
    > same row* in Table 1 as the counterparty. A hedge referencing a
    > \"Technology\" firm cannot be used to proxy a \"Consumer Goods\"
    > counterparty with 50% correlation; it would be treated as having
    > 0% correlation (ineligible).

2.  **Credit Quality Indifference:** The correlation requirement
    > specifies \"Same Sector,\" not \"Same Credit Quality.\" Thus, a
    > firm *could* theoretically hedge a High Yield Energy counterparty
    > with an Investment Grade Energy CDS. However, the \$RW_h\$ used in
    > the calculation would be that of the IG hedge (3.0%), while the
    > exposure \$RW_c\$ would be that of the HY counterparty (7.0%).
    > This creates a risk weight mismatch that naturally reduces the
    > hedge effectiveness in the systematic component, independent of
    > the correlation parameter.

## 6. Region Classifications and Boundaries

The second condition for the 50% correlation bucket is that the hedge
reference entity must reside in the same **Region** as the counterparty.
The definition of \"Region\" in the BA-CVA framework aligns with the
broader Basel 3.1 and Market Risk (FRTB) definitions to ensure
consistency.

### 6.1 Defined Geographic Regions

The regulatory text identifies two primary regional aggregations for the
purpose of risk bucketing and correlation ^1^:

1.  **Advanced Economies:** This region is explicitly defined to include
    > a specific list of countries/jurisdictions:

    -   Canada

    -   United States

    -   Mexico

    -   Euro Area (collectively)

    -   United Kingdom

    -   Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland (Non-Euro Western Europe)

    -   Japan

    -   Australia, New Zealand (Oceania)

    -   Singapore

    -   Hong Kong SAR

2.  **Emerging Markets (Rest of World):** Defined by exclusion; this
    > bucket comprises all economies not listed in the Advanced
    > Economies set.

### 6.2 Application to Proxy Hedging

The binary nature of this definition (Advanced vs. Emerging) has
significant implications for the \"Same Region\" test (\$r\_{hc} =
50\\%\$):

-   **Intra-Region Flexibility:** If the regulation treats \"Advanced
    > Economies\" as a single regional bucket for CVA purposes (as it
    > does for Equity indices in Table 9 of ^6^), then a UK bank could
    > potentially hedge a German counterparty (Advanced) using a US bank
    > CDS (Advanced) and qualify for the 50% correlation, as both are
    > \"Advanced Economies.\"

-   **Inter-Region Prohibition:** A hedge referencing a US corporate
    > (Advanced) applied to a Brazilian corporate exposure (Emerging)
    > would fail the \"Same Region\" test. The correlation would drop to
    > 0%, rendering the hedge ineligible for any capital relief under
    > BA-CVA.

-   **Granularity Risk:** It is crucial to verify the specific statutory
    > instrument\'s granularity. While \"Advanced Economies\" is the
    > standard grouping, if the final PRA rulebook enforces a stricter
    > \"continent-based\" or \"country-based\" region definition for
    > *single-name* proxies (distinct from index buckets), the
    > flexibility would decrease. However, based on the provided
    > snippets linking CVA definitions to Market Risk standards, the
    > Advanced/Emerging split is the operative boundary.^1^

## 7. Currency Mismatch: Explicit vs. Implicit Treatment

A critical technical nuance in the BA-CVA framework is the handling of
currency mismatch between the hedging instrument and the underlying
exposure. Unlike the Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR) framework, the
BA-CVA SNH formula does not include an explicit foreign exchange (FX)
haircut variable.

### 7.1 Absence of Explicit Haircut (**\$H\_{fx}\$**)

Reviewing the \$SNH_c\$ and \$HMAC\$ formulas confirms the absence of a
currency mismatch multiplier or haircut term (often denoted as
\$H\_{fx}\$ in collateral haircuts).

-   **Formula Inputs:** The inputs are strictly: Correlation
    > (\$r\_{hc}\$), Risk Weight (\$RW\$), Maturity (\$M\$), Notional
    > (\$B\$), and Discount Factor (\$DF\$).

-   **No FX Parameter:** There is no parameter reducing the eligible
    > notional based on FX volatility (e.g., reducing the notional by 8%
    > for a 10-day hold). This implies that a USD-denominated CDS used
    > to hedge a GBP-denominated exposure is recognized at its
    > spot-converted notional value without a specific \"currency
    > mismatch\" deduction *within the CVA formula itself*.^2^

### 7.2 Implicit Treatment via Correlation

The regulatory logic treats currency mismatch as a subsidiary component
of basis risk, subsumed under the correlation parameter \$r\_{hc}\$.

-   **100% Correlation:** If a firm buys a CDS on Entity X (USD) to

### 7.3 Distinction from Retail/Collateral Definitions

The research material highlights a \"Currency Mismatch Multiplier\"
(1.5x) and \"Currency Mismatch Haircuts\" (8%) in other contexts, which
must be clearly distinguished from SNH:

-   **Retail/Mortgages:** The 1.5x multiplier applies to *unhedged*
    > borrowers whose income currency differs from the loan currency.^7^
    > This is a credit risk parameter (PD/LGD adjustment), irrelevant to
    > CVA hedges.

-   **Collateral (CRM):** In the calculation of Exposure at Default
    > (EAD), collateral posted in a different currency is subject to an
    > 8% haircut (\$H\_{fx}\$).^4^

    -   *Interaction:* This haircut *increases* the \$EAD\$ (or
        > \$SCVA_c\$) derived from the netting set. Thus, while the
        > *hedge* (\$SNH_c\$) doesn\'t suffer a haircut, the *exposure*
        > (\$SCVA_c\$) effectively increases if the collateral covering
        > it has a currency mismatch. This increases the net capital
        > charge indirectly.

## 8. Operational Mechanics: Maturity and Notional Adjustments

Beyond the correlation and sector constraints, the operational inputs
for Maturity and Notional define the magnitude of hedge recognition.

### 8.1 Maturity Mismatch Mechanics

The BA-CVA calculates hedge duration (\$M_h\^{SN}\$) and exposure
duration (\$M\_{NS}\$) independently.

-   **Linear Adjustment:** The \$SNH_c\$ formula multiplies the hedge
    > notional by \$M_h\^{SN}\$. The \$SCVA_c\$ formula multiplies the
    > exposure by \$M\_{NS}\$.

-   **Implication:** If \$M_h\^{SN} \< M\_{NS}\$ (e.g., a 1-year hedge
    > against a 5-year trade), the hedge term is numerically smaller.
    > The capital relief is reduced linearly in proportion to the time
    > difference. There is no binary \"disallowance\" for maturity
    > mismatches (provided standard eligibility criteria are met); the
    > hedge simply provides less \"dollar-duration\" offset.

-   **Cap/Floor Nuance:**

    -   **Exposure (\$M\_{NS}\$):** For fully collateralized trades, the
        > 1-year maturity floor is removed in BA-CVA (unlike standard
        > CCR), allowing \$M\_{NS}\$ to drop below 1 year. \$M\_{NS}\$
        > is capped at 5 years.

    -   **Hedge (\$M_h\^{SN}\$):** The hedge maturity uses the actual
        > remaining maturity. The discount factor (\$DF\$) also adjusts
        > based on this maturity, slightly accelerating the decay of
        > recognition for longer hedges due to the 5% discount rate.^1^

### 8.2 Notional Mismatch and Contingent CDS

-   **Fixed Notional:** For standard CDS, \$B_h\^{SN}\$ is the face
    > value.

-   **Contingent Notional:** For contingent CDS (where the payout
    > depends on the MTM of a reference portfolio), the notional
    > \$B_h\^{SN}\$ must be reset to the **current market value** of the
    > reference portfolio.^1^ This prevents firms from claiming a fixed
    > high notional for a hedge that effectively provides little
    > protection because the underlying portfolio is out-of-the-money.

-   **Allocation:** Firms must allocate hedges specifically to CVA risk.
    > A hedge cannot be double-counted for Market Risk (trading book)
    > capital relief and CVA capital relief. If a desk hedges a trading
    > book bond and a CVA exposure with the same CDS, the notional must
    > be split or allocated to one distinct risk type.^1^

## 9. Conclusion

The Full BA-CVA framework constructs a rigorous environment for
single-name hedging where capital relief is tightly controlled by the
quality of the hedge alignment. The system is defined by:

1.  **A Capital Floor:** The \$\\beta=0.25\$ parameter ensures that
    > hedging can never eliminate more than 75% of the gross CVA capital
    > requirement.

2.  **Prescriptive Correlations:** The displacement of internal models
    > with fixed correlation buckets (100%, 80%, 50%) standardizes the
    > treatment of basis risk.

3.  **The HMAC Penalty:** The additive, non-diversifiable HMAC charge
    > imposes a severe quadratic cost on proxy hedging, particularly
    > when using high-volatility (high risk weight) proxies.

4.  **Implicit Currency Treatment:** Currency mismatch is regulated via
    > correlation tiers and collateral haircuts on the exposure side,
    > rather than explicit haircuts on the hedge instrument itself.

For firms operating under these rules, the incentive structure heavily
favors direct hedging (100% correlation) to avoid the HMAC \"safety
tax,\" while providing a structured, albeit expensive, pathway for proxy
hedging illiquid exposures via the Sector/Region buckets.
